## Installation
**Stop!** This program is already installed in the OCCP Admin VM. Since this program was designed to run on the OCCP Admin VM, it makes assumptions about its run-time environment. If you are just looking to use this program, simply run it from your Admin VM. If you wish to contribute to this program, pull the latest version on your Admin VM. Installing this on anything but the Admin VM is highly discouraged.
